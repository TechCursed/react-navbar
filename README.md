# React + Bootstrap NavBar

This repository consists the learning of Navigation Bar , which is the very first element in the majority of the webapps.
The topics I learned creating this repo are:

## ReactBootstrap Library

ReactBootstrap Library is a very simple way of creating a Responsive Navbar in react.

In order to install the dependency, use :  <strong> *npm i react-bootstrap bootstrap* </strong>

## React Router DOM

React Router DOM dependency is used for the routing purposes in React, it's really helpful in dealing with links througout the whole react app.
